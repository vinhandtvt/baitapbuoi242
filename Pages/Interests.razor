            <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid
                skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free
                climbing, and kayaking.

                When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an
                aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements
                in the front-end web development world.</p>
